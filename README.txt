Problem description 

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.
On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.
We ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

Overview

This project aims to predict the survival rate among passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project contains information about the passengers on board, including their age, sex, class, and cabin location. By analyzing this data, we can develop a model that predicts the likelihood of survival for a given passenger.

Data

The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers on the Titanic. The dataset is publicly available and can be found in the Kaggle repository. The data has been cleaned and preprocessed to remove missing values and unnecessary columns.
Methodology

The project uses the following steps:

    Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure and distribution of the data.
    Data preprocessing to clean and transform the data into a suitable format for machine learning algorithms.
    Model training using logistic regression.
    Model evaluation to determine the performance of the model.

Results

The final model achieved an accuracy score of 75% on the test dataset, which suggests that it can predict the survival rate of passengers with reasonable accuracy. The model was able to identify several key factors that affect the survival rate, including age, sex, and passenger class.
Dependencies

This project requires the following dependencies:

    Python (version 3.x)
    Pandas
    NumPy
    Matplotlib
    Scikit-learn

Conclusion

In conclusion, this project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to predict the survival rate among passengers on the Titanic. By analyzing the data and developing a predictive model, we can gain insights into the factors that influence the likelihood of survival and potentially improve the safety of future sea travel.
